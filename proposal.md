## Description
The Celestial Combat Game is a 2D arcade-style game where players control a spaceship to shoot down incoming enemies. This project combines programming skills with design principles, making it highly relevant to media and digital arts.

## Features
- Feature 1:
Player Controls

Players can move their spaceship left and right and shoot bullets using keyboard controls. This will be executed through event handling to manage user input.

- Feature 2:
Enemy Generation

Enemies will spawn at random positions at the top of the screen and move downward. This will be executed using a loop that continuously generates enemies and updates their positions.

- Feature 3
Scoring System:

Players earn points for each enemy hit and lose points if enemies reach the bottom of the screen. This will be implemented by maintaining a score variable and updating it based on collisions.

- Feature 4:
Graphics and Sound Effects

The game will feature colorful graphics for the player, enemies, and bullets, as well as sound effects for shooting and scoring. This will be achieved using Pygame's rendering capabilities and sound modules.


## Challenges
-Learning to implement collision detection effectively to ensure accurate interactions between bullets and enemies.
-Researching how to optimize game performance to handle multiple enemies and bullets on screen without lag.
-Exploring sound design to enhance the gaming experience with background music and sound effects. Learning more about the sound modules of PyGame.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is a fully functional space shooter game with smooth gameplay, engaging graphics, and sound effects that provide an enjoyable experience for players.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal viable outcome includes a basic game where players can move their spaceship, shoot bullets, and earn points by hitting enemies, with a simple score display.

## Milestones
- Week 1:
 1) Set up the development environment and familiarize with PyGame and other required modules.
 2) Implement basic player movement and shooting mechanics.

- Week 2:
 1) Create enemy generation and movement mechanics.
 2) Develop a scoring system and collision detection.

- Week 3:
 1) Integrate graphics and sound effects to enhance the game experience.
 2) Test the game and fix any bugs.

- Week 4 (Final):
  1) Prepare final presentation.
  2) Create video demonstration.
  3) Upload to YouTube.
